# Visomaster-Fusion-Patches
A patch that adds stuff for Visomaster that developers refused while waving their developer dickies at me. 
LLM's will fix that soon enough 😏.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### WHAT DOES IT ADD?

- If you use embeddings, your output files will be put into a folder named after the embedding you use (will still use your output path to create those folders). (*1)
- A 'Clear Media' button to let you remove (not delete) and unload the media you loaded into "target videos/images" also unloading the currently loaded file. (*2)
- Mouse scroll wheel will not move sliders if you do not focus on them first by clicking them. (*3)


### WHAT FOR?

*1 If you work with many characters that you want to classify, you know that mixing all of them into the same folder can be troublesome later. This lets you have each character into its own folder for easy classification and management. You will have to name your embeddings accordingly for this to have any meaning.

*2 If you leave an image or video loaded in Viso, close it, then delete that file, the app will not launch anymore without manually removing that file from your workspace.json file. This button makes it easier to "clean before exit" and prevents this. Also, its easier than having to go on each one removing it or selecting a dummy empty folder.

*3 I was tired of modifying settings accidentally while scrolling the right panel. This option gives you freedom, no more "finding the good spot to scroll".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This mod is rather for patient people that will not update everytime an update comes. 'N' is your friend here. **Every update will replace your patch with the vanilla version of the app**. Development is very unstable so you should be doing this anyway. I will do my best to update it when a significant update comes since I am using it, you can expect that to happen anyway. 
My personal advice is to make a backup before updating the app.


### INSTRUCTIONS:

1 - Download the "app.zip" from releases. MATCH YOUR VISOMASTER VERSION otherwise it will have unpredictable results.

2 - Unzip into ..\VisoMaster-Fusion\  replacing your current `app` folder.

3 - Replace all files.



### THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE APP. YOU MUST INSTALL IT FIRST USING THE [PORTABLE VERSION](https://github.com/VisoMasterFusion/VisoMaster-Fusion/blob/main/Start_Portable.bat) THEY HAVE.
